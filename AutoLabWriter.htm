    (name)[Paul Torrington]
    (title)[How does the wingspan of a paper aeroplane affect the distance it flies.]
    (problemdescription)[Paper planes can fly long distances because the wings help provide an upwards force keeping it in the air longer. The longer its in the air the further it can fly because distance = speed * time.]
    (dvhyp)[increase]
    (hypsci)[The larger the wing the more surface area it has. Therefore the longer it will stay in the air and the further it will go.]
    (hypdetail)[Air moving over the wing provides lift. The longer the wings the more lift they will provide. ]
    (ivvar)[I will start off with a wide paper plane . I will then cut off strips with a pair of scissors.]
    (dvvar)[I will use a long tape measure that I will stretch out along the floor. When the plane hits the floor I will see where along the tape it landed.]
    (datapoints)[9]
    (repeats)[3]
    (relationship)[Linear]
    (updown)[up]
    (discuss)[I think as the wingspan increases there is more lift. The planes did stay in the air for longer when they had a bigger wingspan.]
    (conclusion)[My prediction was correct. I think that was because the longer wingspan provided more lift. The longer wings also had a better shape which helped the plane to fly. The line didnt go up as steeply as I expected {meaning that the wingspan didnt make the distance very much longer. I think that was because the longer wings meant the planes didnt fly as straight as short wings. ]
    (correlation)[medium]
    (numanom)[1]
    (anoms)[The datapoint at 9cm is much lower than the others. I think that is because the plane flipped upside down on one of the trials and on the other two trials it didnt fly straight.]
    (methsuc)[quite well]
    (evalreason)[I found that it was easy to get data but sometimes it was hard to throw the plane with the same speed]
    (issues)[Throwing the planes exactly the same was difficult
    Sometimes the planes bounced when they landed
    The nose of the plane got bent when it landed]
    (newlow)[Default]
    (newhigh)[Default]
    (newrange)[I would use 1cm to 20 cm. I would need to use A3 paper and maybe I would use card to help such big planes keep their shape]
    (newrepeats)[5]
    (solutions):[I could get more practice throwing the planes before starting the experiment or launch them using an elastic band.
    I could put bluetack or paint on the end so they stay stil or leave a mark where they landed
    I could use a new plane if it got too bent
     but I would have to be careful to make it exactly the same]
    (fur)[I could investigate how wingspan affects the time take for the plane to hit the ground. That way I could see if the reasoning for my hypothesis was correct]
    (cvvar)[Use the same paper for each plane (A4 white 80g)
    I will use the same design for each plane
    When I cut off the strips I will add blue tack weighing the same amount to the plane
    I will practice throwing at the same speed.
    I will release the plane at my head height (1.8m) every time.]

    Throw the first plane and measure the distance and record it.
    Repeat step 2 three times.
    Cut 1cm off both wings and repeat steps 2-3.
    Continue until the wings are 1cm wide ]
